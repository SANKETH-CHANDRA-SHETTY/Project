            <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>

            <p><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian 
                aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. 
                He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace 
                engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, 
                mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space 
                Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space 
                programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the 
                Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
                vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and 
                political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the 
                original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
